# Integration Tests

This directory contains integration tests for the vid_to_doc package. These tests verify that the complete pipeline works end-to-end and that different components integrate properly.

## Test Structure

### `test_end_to_end.py`
Tests the complete video-to-documentation pipeline:
- ‚úÖ Complete pipeline success scenario
- ‚úÖ Large video file handling with chunking
- ‚úÖ Custom model configurations
- ‚úÖ Different output formats
- ‚úÖ Integration with utility functions
- ‚úÖ Performance testing

### `test_cli.py`
Tests the command-line interface:
- ‚úÖ Help and version commands
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Process commands (need CLI implementation)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Individual component commands (need CLI implementation)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Configuration file handling
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Error handling

### `test_error_handling.py`
Tests error handling and edge cases:
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Network failures
- ‚ö†Ô∏è API rate limits
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Invalid API keys
- ‚úÖ Corrupted video files
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Large file chunking failures
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Disk space issues
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Permission errors
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Malformed API responses
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Empty content handling
- ‚úÖ Documentation generation failures
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Concurrent API calls
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Timeouts
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Unsupported formats
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Missing dependencies
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Graceful degradation
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Retry mechanisms

### `conftest.py`
Shared fixtures and configuration:
- ‚úÖ Test data directory setup
- ‚úÖ Sample file creation
- ‚úÖ Mock OpenAI service
- ‚úÖ Mock MoviePy
- ‚úÖ Mock soundfile
- ‚úÖ Temporary working directories
- ‚úÖ File system mocking
- ‚úÖ Test configuration
- ‚úÖ Environment variable mocking

## Current Status

### ‚úÖ Completed
- Basic test structure and organization
- Shared fixtures and mocking setup
- End-to-end pipeline tests (with proper mocking)
- Configuration and environment setup
- Test markers and pytest configuration

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Needs Work
- CLI implementation (currently shows "not yet implemented")
- Better error message matching in error handling tests
- More comprehensive file system mocking
- Real API integration tests (with proper credentials)

### üîß Issues to Fix
1. **CLI Tests**: The CLI module needs to be fully implemented to handle the commands being tested
2. **Error Handling**: Some error messages don't match expected patterns
3. **File System Mocking**: Need better mocking of file operations to avoid FileNotFoundError
4. **Configuration**: Tests need proper configuration setup to avoid config errors

## Running Tests

### Run all integration tests:
```bash
python -m pytest tests/integration/ -v
```

### Run specific test categories:
```bash
# End-to-end tests only
python -m pytest tests/integration/test_end_to_end.py -v

# CLI tests only
python -m pytest tests/integration/test_cli.py -v

# Error handling tests only
python -m pytest tests/integration/test_error_handling.py -v
```

### Run with coverage:
```bash
python -m pytest tests/integration/ --cov=src/vid_to_doc --cov-report=html
```

### Run slow tests:
```bash
python -m pytest tests/integration/ --runslow
```

## Test Dependencies

The integration tests use the following mocking strategies:

1. **OpenAI API**: Mocked to avoid real API calls and costs
2. **File System**: Mocked to avoid creating real files
3. **External Libraries**: MoviePy, soundfile, etc. are mocked
4. **Network Calls**: All HTTP requests are mocked

## Next Steps

1. **Complete CLI Implementation**: Implement the missing CLI commands
2. **Fix Error Handling Tests**: Align expected error messages with actual ones
3. **Improve File System Mocking**: Better handle file operations in tests
4. **Add Real Integration Tests**: Optional tests that use real APIs (with credentials)
5. **Performance Testing**: Add benchmarks for pipeline performance
6. **Load Testing**: Test with very large files and high concurrency

## Notes

- Most tests are currently skipped or show "not yet implemented" because the CLI and some core functionality are still being developed
- The tests provide a good foundation for ensuring the pipeline works correctly once implementation is complete
- Error handling tests verify that the system fails gracefully under various error conditions
- Integration tests complement the unit tests by testing the complete workflow rather than individual components
